# 🌱 Quick Numeric Input

## NEW: Type Numbers Instead of Arrows!

All three passes now support **typing numbers** instead of arrow key navigation.

## Pass 1: Priorities

```
Task 5/51
Fix editor jumping bug (email)
(from: Silvermine AI)

Priority:
  0. P0 - Urgent + Important
  1. P1 - Important, not urgent
  2. P2 - Urgent, not important
  3. P3 - Not important, not urgent
  d. Done (mark complete)
  s. Skip

> 0 ↵
  ✓ P0
```

**Just type:** `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `d`, or `s`

### NEW: Done Option!
- Type `d` or `done` to **mark task as complete**
- Done tasks are filtered out of Pass 2 & 3
- Perfect for quick cleanup

## Pass 2: Projects

```
Task 1/42
Fix editor jumping bug (email)
[P0]

Project:
  0. WORKDAY
  1. LIFE
  2. SILVERMINE
  s. Skip (no project)

> 2 ↵
  ✓ SILVERMINE
```

**Just type:** `0`, `1`, `2`, or `s`

## Pass 3: Time Estimates

```
Task 1/42
Fix editor jumping bug (email)
[P0][SILVERMINE]

Time estimate:
  0. 15m
  1. 30m
  2. 1h
  3. 2h
  4. 3h
  5. 4h
  6. 8h
  s. Skip

> 2 ↵
  ✓ 1h
```

**Just type:** `0-6` or `s`

## Why This Is Better

**For ADHD + speed:**
- ✅ **Muscle memory** - 0,1,2,3 is way faster than arrows
- ✅ **No aiming** - type and hit enter, done
- ✅ **Keyboard flow** - never leave home row
- ✅ **Skip quickly** - just hit `s` + Enter (or just Enter)
- ✅ **Done option** - mark complete without leaving triage

## Shortcuts Summary

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `0-3` | Set priority P0-P3 |
| `d` | Mark as Done |
| `s` | Skip this task |
| `Enter` (empty) | Skip this task |
| `Ctrl+C` or `ESC` | Cancel triage |

## Example Speed Run

```
> 0 ↵         # P0
> 2 ↵         # SILVERMINE
> 2 ↵         # 1h estimate
```

**3 keystrokes, 1 task triaged!** 🚀

## Tips

- **P0 is always 0** - urgent urgent urgent
- **Silvermine is usually 2** - muscle memory kicks in
- **1h is usually 2** - most tasks are ~1 hour
- **Just hit Enter** to skip uncertain tasks
- **Use 'd' liberally** - cleaning out done tasks feels good

Enjoy the speed! 🌱⚡
